# Downloadr
This is a downloader of many things, torrents, arbitrary urls, bandcamp,
 soundcloud, and other junk.

# Features
This is the initial feature set that we have to work for in the first release.
Downloadr can download from a variety of sources such as:
  * Download movies, tv shows, and anime from [yts.to](http://yts.to)
  * Download from bandcamp
  * Download from soundcloud
  * what.cd/animebytes.tv
Downloadr can interface with rTorrent or Transmission for torrenting 
while other sources can use node.js built in http handling to scrape and 
download from bandcamp and soundcloud.

# Build system
Something about grunt, test coverage, not wanting to pay for coveralls or 
code climate. Something about generating our own badges for giving us 
metrics and junk. 

# CI
Downloader uses travis-ci. Everyone sign up for github educational pack so 
you can get a ton of free shit.

# Redmine/trello/youtrack
Since we are working with a team of 3, we will need a way to manage the team.
Redmine is an excelent project management tool written in RoR. Trello is 
basically an online scrum board. YouTrack is made by the people who make pycharm and intelliJ IDEA
