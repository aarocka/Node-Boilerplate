# Downloadr
This is a downloader of many things, torrents, arbitrary urls, bandcamp,
 soundcloud, and other junk.

# Features
This is the initial feature set that we have to work for in the first release.
Downloadr can download from a variety of sources such as:
  * Download movies, tv shows, and anime from [yts.to](http://yts.to)
  * Download from bandcamp
  * Download from soundcloud
  * what.cd/animebytes.tv
Downloadr can interface with rTorrent or Transmission for torrenting 
while other sources can use node.js built in http handling to scrape and 
download from bandcamp and soundcloud.

# Build system
Something about grunt, test coverage, not wanting to pay for coveralls or 
code climate. Something about generating our own badges for giving us 
metrics and junk. 

# CI
Downloader uses travis-ci. Everyone sign up for github educational pack so 
you can get a ton of free shit.

# Project management
We will be using agile development. I changed my mind and now would rather 
use trello. I found that it's easier to work with and can be modified to 
produce charts and interface with github issues.
